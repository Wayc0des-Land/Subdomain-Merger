# Subdomain-Merger

This Go program reads subdomains from two files, merges them into a single list, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and writes the result to a file.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
3. Update the filenames in the `main` function of `main.go` to match your subdomain files.

## Usage

1. Place your subdomain lists in two separate text files: `first.txt` and `second.txt`.
2. Run the program using the following command:

   ```shell
   go run main.go
   
The merged and sorted subdomains will be written to merged.txt in the current directory.
